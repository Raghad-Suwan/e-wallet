                     <h4>Why Was Established?</h4>
                     <p> Cash financial transactions control the economy in Palestine.
                         The ratio of Palestinians who have bank accounts is about 30% of 
                         the number of citizens eligible for opening bank accounts. 
                         This results in 95% of financial transactions being carried out in 
                         cash resulting in increasing the value and cost of cash itself! 
                         This imposed a heavy burden on the Palestinian economy represented by its banks, traders, and citizens.
                         Hence, Jawwal Pay will fill the vacuum of absent electronic payment services 
                         urgently needed by the Palestinian market, through innovative electronic payment systems 
                         to transfer the national economy into an advanced digital economy

                     <p>
                         Palestenian individuals will benefit . 
                         Electronic payment and wallet services will contribute to a large extent to 
                         reducing cost for all sectors of society in addition to providing comfort, convenience, a
                         nd time for users.
